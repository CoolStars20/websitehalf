  <h2><span id="topicalinterestrooms">Topical interest rooms</span></h2>
  <div class="c12 row">
    <p>To facilitate collaboration on subjects of common interest we plan to host a number of "topical interest rooms" for about an hour at the end of each day's session. Unlike "Splinter sessions" in traditional Cool Stars conferences, a "topical interest room" does not have a list of speakers or presentations, but just a minimal agenda with maybe 3-5 subtopics to discuss. Anybody is free to share slides and data in a working group format. Possible discussion topics should be broad enough to be of general interest and narrow enough that a science goal could be effectively discussed in no more than one hour. Use the form below to suggest a topic (and volunteer to chair a room with the topic you suggested). Deadline for suggestions: Feb 19 2021.<p>
